It recognized hand numbers {0,1,2,3,4,5} from image (webcam) by using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

You can jump step 2 and 3 and directly test it with traind modles and weights (step 3)

1. saving_data.py  ==> read images and save it as binary data

2. training.py  ==> training a Deep CNN with Keras

3. test_by_webcam.py  ==> testing results by a webcam

Note: it succesfukly tested on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit
